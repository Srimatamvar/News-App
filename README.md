**REACT JS ASSIGNMENT- "News App with Firebase integration"**


I've designed a News app using Next.JS to fetch news articles from an API(News API), allowing authorized users to access and read news articles even when offline. 
I've provided the users with the option to save their favorite news articles to a personal list. 
This app also provides with Grid View, and  implements Google authentication and utilizes Firebase Firestore for data Storage.

State management is being handled usong Redux.


**Getting Started**

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev



Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
